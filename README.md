The next not-so-daily code exercise.

# About
Two items of note on this project.
 * Built using Gradle instead of Maven.
 * Includes procedure for how I start these projects.

# Project Initiation Procedure
I've created these projects a couple of different ways. It may not be considered correct or ideal, but the method that seems easiest is the following:

1. Create the project on GitHub.com to initialize the repository.
2. Perform a 'git clone' in your working directory to pull the starter files.
3. Next, go to springinitializr.io generate the project files. After completing the form, press 'Generate' to download the project files.
4. Rename the .gitignore file to something else, like 'spring.gitignore'.
5. Then, copy all of the downloaded files. Paste them into the cloned git project folder. 
6. Next, open the project in IntelliJ.
7. Copy the 'spring.gitignore' contents into the existing '.gitignore' file. There may be duplicate entries.
8. Delete the 'spring.gitignore' file.
9. Now, the project has the spring starter files ready to go.
10. Add all the new files to the local repo and push it up to the remote/origin.
